# Text-Mining-R-Questions
A repository to analyze R-programming questions asked on StackOverflow (till Sept-2017).

I couldn't resist to analyze such an interesting [Kaggle-data-set](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/rquestions/data) given the 
fact that I am an aspiring Data Scientist!

My goal here is to find similar questions from all the questions asked on StackOverflow for R-programming languages (till Sept 2017).
This can help organizing questions/answers better and it's an unsupervised approach which works with minimal human intervention.

Code and sample o/p is available in the rmd/html file in **script** directory.


I'm still working on improving the performace. So, the next steps include: Further tuning of existing model (mayebe dimensionality reduction, 
feature selection), and RNN-LSTM.
